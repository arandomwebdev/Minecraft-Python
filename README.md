If the blocks appear blurry, add a file called settings.prc with text model-cache-dir written in the file. 
At the beginning of the Python Files of the main game, add the line loadPrcFile('settings.prc')
The main game files are available with or without a terrain base called with_terrain_base and without_terrain_base.
Add the load PRC file to both.
